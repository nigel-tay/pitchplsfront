## Planning and Development Process

Phase 1: Pre-Project week<br/>
Discuss on potential project ideas and shortlist the best few. Eventually decided on our current project Pitch Please.
After discussing as a group what we foresee the app to need, each member was delegated a task to further research upon.

Applications like Trello and Figma was used to help us plan and delegate work.

#### Trello, a kanban board tool allowing better planning and clarity<br/>

#### More detailed design work with Figma. Planning colours for the theme of our app<br/>

Phase 2: First half of Project Week<br/>
We knew from previous experience that it was important to have a good foundation to build upon.

We agreed upon what was required for the backend (models, routes, etc), before proceeding with component creation on React.

Rough layout and main components were created, alongside the paths that linked the frontend together. Once that was done, we could finally link both front and backends together to start mapping our information to be displayed on the frontend.

Some functions we implemented:

Separate dashboards for Job seekers and Recruiters, including different funcitonality for the Post-it pitches.

#### Recruiter view<br/>

#### Search function<br/>

Phase 3: The final stretch; Finishing up the Project<br/>
By Thursday we were 90% done. All that was left was to continue working on our chat function and polish the site's CSS.

### Problem-Solving Strategy

Working on our problems together helped the team understand different complexities of the different components in the project.

It was the first time any of us were attempting to implement a live chat. Hence it was difficult understanding its complexities.
We tried our best to break down this daunting task into smaller problems that we could take on and slowly worked our way up.

Many heads tackling a single problem made project progression much smoother.

### Unsolved problems

We were still unable to implement a realtime chat with react redux. We tried our best to implement it without redux but could not. Currently, all chats are non user specific as well.
